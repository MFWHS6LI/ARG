    <p class="paragraph">Someone found this! My name is John Smith, I’m a magazine writer. Four days ago I woke up in a very dark room with no exit, a computer and a USB drive. I plugged in the USB drive and found a message and some kind of encoded script. The message told me to solve to riddle if I wanted to leave. I have been trying for days but I have not gotten anywhere. I was not able to do much on the computer but I managed to hack into this kids website. I have figured out that it’s an ADFGX Cipher, the problem being that this cipher needs a key and an alphabet consisting of 25 letters to solve. To hide my presence I will keep on hiding messages on the kid's websites, but it also seems that whoever locked me up in here will be hiding the puzzles there as well. If you crack the code or find the key, please try to help me.</p>
